When trading, emotion equals danger. Trading bots, on the other hand, completely lack emotion and are immune to the hype and noise which befall so many, especially novice traders. Humans also were found lacking the ability to; abide by a strict set of rules and; abandon rules or habits in favor of better, more useful ones. They are slow to adapt when something isnâ€™t working. But bots are continuing to get smarter. With advances in AI, bots are capable of self-optimizing, to determine the best methods to achieve the greatest outcomes for any given task. </p></div><div class="col" data-v-fbd21580><h3 data-v-fbd21580>Product Overview</h3><p data-v-fbd21580> Our product is an electronic trading platform that can execute repetitive tasks at speeds of orders whose magnitude is greater than the human equivalent, Making use of strategic formulas to execute trades. <br data-v-fbd21580><br data-v-fbd21580> Systematic Trading makes use of computer models to define trade goals, risk controls and rules that can execute trade orders in a methodical way. <br data-v-fbd21580><br data-v-fbd21580> Pairs trading or pair trading is a long-short, ideally market-neutral strategy enabling traders to profit from transient discrepancies in relative value of close substitutes. </p></div></div><div class="mission exec" data-v-fbd21580><div class="col" data-v-fbd21580><h3 data-v-fbd21580>Licenses</h3><p data-v-fbd21580><b data-v-fbd21580>Officially Approved by the Dubai Government</b><br data-v-fbd21580>Inara Equinix proudly holds all necessary approvals from the Dubai government, ensuring compliance and credibility in all our operations. </p></div></div><div class="team" data-v-fbd21580><h3 data-v-fbd21580>Our Leaders</h3><div class="row" data-v-fbd21580><div class="member" data-v-fbd21580><img src="'+a+'" alt="" data-v-fbd21580><h4 data-v-fbd21580>Ria Robin Mohamed Rafi</h4><p data-v-fbd21580>Founder</p></div><div class="member" data-v-fbd21580><img src="'+a+'" alt="" data-v-fbd21580><h4 data-v-fbd21580>John Doe</h4><p data-v-fbd21580>Co Founder</p></div></div></div>',7),m=[v],f={__name:"about",setup(b){return d(()=>{document.getElementById("__nuxt").scrollTo(0,0)}),(u,p)=>(r(),o("div",l,m))}},y=s(f,[["__scopeId","data-v-fbd21580"]]);export{y as default};
